## 🧠 AI Features You Need to Build

### 1. **AI Analysis API Endpoint** ⚡
**Location:** `server/routes/analyze-wellbeing.ts`  
**Status:** 🟡 Partially implemented, needs completion

**What it should do:**
- Receive user onboarding data (10 wellness questions + profile info)
- Send structured prompt to OpenAI API
- Generate personalized wellness insights
- Return analysis in specific format

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// Basic structure exists but needs enhancement
POST /api/analyze-wellbeing
// Input: { userId, responses, profileData }
// Output: { insights, recommendations, wellnessScore }
```

### 2. **Frontend AI Results Display** 🎨
**Location:** `client/pages/onboarding/OnboardingResults.tsx`  
**Status:** 🔴 Needs implementation

**Requirements:**
- Display AI-generated insights in an engaging UI
- Show wellness score with visual indicators
- Present personalized recommendations
- Include "Continue to Dashboard" button

### 3. **AI Analysis Integration** 🔗
**Location:** `client/pages/onboarding/OnboardingAnalysis.tsx`  
**Status:** 🟡 Loading UI exists, needs API integration

**Current State:**
- Shows "Analyzing your responses..." with loading animation
- Automatically redirects to results after 3 seconds
- **You need to:** Replace mock delay with actual API call

---

## 📊 Data Structure You'll Work With

### User Response Data Format
```typescript
interface UserResponses {
  userId: string;
  responses: {
    [questionId: string]: {
      questionText: string;
      selectedOption: string;
      score: number;
    }
  };
  profileData: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    goals: string[];
    lifestyle: string;
    // ... other profile fields
  };
  totalScore: number;
  categoryScores: {
    physical: number;
    mental: number;
    social: number;
    emotional: number;
  };
}
```

### Expected AI Response Format
```typescript
interface AIAnalysis {
  wellnessScore: number; // 0-100
  insights: {
    strengths: string[];
    areasForImprovement: string[];
    keyObservations: string;
  };
  recommendations: {
    immediate: string[];
    longTerm: string[];
    resources: string[];
  };
  personalizedMessage: string;
}
```

## 🛠 Technical Implementation Details

### Environment Variables You Need
```env
# Already in .env.example
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### OpenAI Integration Guidelines
1. **Model:** Use `gpt-4` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`
2. **Token Limit:** Keep responses under 2000 tokens
3. **Temperature:** Use 0.7 for balanced creativity/consistency
4. **System Prompt:** Create a wellness expert persona

### Supabase Database Integration
- Store AI analysis results in `user_analyses` table
- Link to user profiles via `user_id`
- Cache results to avoid regenerating for same responses

    wellness_score INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 🚨 Important Notes & Gotchas

### Database Connection Issues
- If you get "profiles table doesn't exist" errors, check the SQL setup scripts
- User profiles might need manual creation during development

### API Rate Limits
- OpenAI has rate limits - implement proper error handling
- Consider implementing request queuing for high traffic

### Data Privacy
- Never log actual user responses in console
- Ensure GDPR compliance in data handling
- AI analysis should be stored securely

### Frontend State Management
- Use the existing `OnboardingContext` for data flow
- Don't modify the context structure - work with existing state
