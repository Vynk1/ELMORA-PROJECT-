```

Update the generated `.env` file:

```env
# Google Cloud Services
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/service-account-key.json

# Server Configuration  
PORT=3001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:8081

## üéØ Usage

### Frontend Integration

The chatbot is automatically integrated into the main app after mood selection. It appears as a floating green chat bubble (üåø) in the bottom-right corner.

**Component Props:**
```typescript
interface ElmoraChatProps {
  currentMood?: MoodType;     // Current user mood
  userPoints?: number;        // User's current points
  onPointsUpdate?: (points: number) => void; // Points update callback
}
```

### Backend API

The chat server runs on port 3001 and provides these endpoints:

- `POST /api/chat` - Main chat endpoint
- `GET /api/chat/health` - Health check
- `DELETE /api/chat/user/:userId` - Delete user data (privacy)
- `GET /api/audio/:filename` - Serve TTS audio files

### Starting the Services

1. **Development Mode** (with frontend):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Chat Server Only**:
   ```bash
   node server/elmora-chat-server.js
   ```

3. **With Google Services** (requires proper .env setup):
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/key.json node server/elmora-chat-server.js
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Testing Without Google Services

The chatbot includes intelligent fallback responses that work without Google Cloud services. This allows for testing and development without API costs.

```bash
# Test with fallback responses
node server/elmora-chat-server.js
```

### Testing With Google Services

1. Set up your `.env` file with valid Google Cloud credentials
2. Start the server
3. Test these conversation flows:

#### Mood Check-in
- "How are you feeling?"
- "I'm feeling sad"
- "I want to do a mood check-in"

#### Journaling  
- "Help me journal"
- "I want to write about my day"
- "Give me a writing prompt"

#### Meditation
- "Guide me through meditation"
- "I need to relax"
- "Help me breathe"

#### Goals
- "Check my goals"
- "I want to set a goal" 
- "Help me track progress"

#### Rewards
- "Show my rewards"
- "I want to celebrate"
- "What have I accomplished?"

### API Testing

Test the chat endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello", "currentMood": "mid", "userPoints": 10, "userId": "test-user"}'
```
