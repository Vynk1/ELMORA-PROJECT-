# Placeholder Audio Files

For development, you can create small placeholder audio files:

## Quick Setup:
1. Find 3 short audio clips (10-30 seconds each)
2. Rename them to:
   - `lofi1.mp3`
   - `rain.mp3` 
   - `ocean.mp3`
3. Place them in this `/public/music/` directory

## Alternative for Testing:
Use any existing audio files you have locally and rename them appropriately.
The PomodoroCard component will handle missing files gracefully.

## Online Resources:
- Freesound.org (free)
- YouTube Audio Library (free)
- Any royalty-free music sites

The audio files should be in MP3 format for maximum browser compatibility.
